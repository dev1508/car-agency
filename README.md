Hey there!
<br>
I hope you are doing great.

This is a project having REST apis, made using `Spring boot` framework of `Java` and `MongoDB` is used for storing the data.

I have followed this [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PdEmeopJVQ).
But there are still few things which you may find new in this project. One of them 
is error handling which was not the part of the tutorial video. Find more by diving 
into this project.

---------------------------------
> **Tech** used in this project are mentioned below.
> <li>Spring Boot (Backend)</li>
> <li>MongoDB (Database)</li>

Steps to run this project on your local system are the following.

<ol>
<li><strong>Git Clone</strong> the project onto your system.</li>
<li>In the folder <strong>src/main/resources</strong>, make a file with name <strong>.env</strong>.
The env file structuring is given below.</li>
<li>The project can be started by navigating to the file 
<strong>src/main/java/com/example/agency/AgencyApplication.java
</strong> <br>
and pressing the <strong> Run AgencyApplication.java</strong> button.
</li>
<li>In case the default port 8080 is already in use, we can set the
<strong>server.port="a-port-number"</strong> in the <strong>src/main/resources/application.properties</strong> file.
</li>
<li>Now we can hit the apis in the postman while the application is running.</li>
</ol>

> 
> .env file structure would be like<br>
> >MONGO_DATABASE="database-name"<br>
> MONGO_USER="user-name"<br>
> MONGO_PASSWORD="user-password"<br>
